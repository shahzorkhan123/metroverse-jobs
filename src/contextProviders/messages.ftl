industry-space-para-1 = The Industry Space showcases the technological relatedness between all industries, shown as dots in this visualization, and groups them into knowledge clusters. Industries that are near each other typically require similar know-how. The size of the dots shows the relative presence in comparison to {
  $benchmark-type ->
  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar population and income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar population and income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
  [world] the world
} of each industry in { $name }. Thereby, we obtain a bird’s eye view of the economic composition of { $name } in terms of the knowledge clusters in which it excels.
industry-space-para-2 = { $name-plural } position in the Industry Space, helps understand which diversification paths may be available to the city, as industries close to those that are already well-developed in { $name } are likely candidates for growth.

growth-opportunities-title = What are the growth opportunities in { $name }?
growth-opportunities-para-1 = Building on all these measures, we can rank industries not only by their relative presence in { $name }, but by their relative technological fit to { $name-plural } productive structure. These measures can help analysts understand how { $name-plural } economic strengths and weakness compare to those of {
  $benchmark-type ->
  *[benchmark_city_name] { $benchmark-type }
  [global_pop] global peers by similar population
  [global_income] global peers by similar population and income per capita
  [global_eucdist] global peers by similar economic structure
  [regional_pop] regional peers by similar population
  [regional_income] regional peers by similar population and income per capita
  [regional_eucdist] regional peers by similar economic structure
  [region] all regional peers
  [world] the world
}. Additionally, it can help identify industries that are surprisingly large (or small) in { $name }.

  <p>
    <strong>Metroverse-Jobs</strong> is an adaptation of the <a target="_blank" href="https://metroverse.cid.harvard.edu/">Metroverse</a> urban economy navigator, originally built by the <a target="_blank" href="https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/">Growth Lab</a> at Harvard University. This version has been adapted to visualize US occupation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of using establishment-level data from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (as the original Metroverse does), Metroverse-Jobs uses:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BLS Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OES)</strong> for employment and wage data across 22 SOC major occupation groups</li>
    <li><strong>O*NET</strong> task data for occupation complexity scoring</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The tool provides interactive treemap visualizations showing occupation composition at three geographic levels: National (United States), State (all 50 states), and Metropolitan Area (21 top metro areas).

about-pilot-user-group-title = Data Sources
about-pilot-user-group-html =
  <h3>BLS Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OES)</h3>
  <p>
    The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/">OES program</a> produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations at the national, state, and metropolitan area levels. This survey covers all full-time and part-time wage and salary workers in nonfarm industries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Metroverse-Jobs uses OES data for: total employment (TOT_EMP), annual mean wage (A_MEAN), and derived GDP estimates (employment &times; wage) for each occupation and region.
  </p>
  <h3>O*NET (Occupational Information Network)</h3>
  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.onetonline.org/">O*NET OnLine</a> is the nation's primary source of occupational information, developed under the sponsorship of the US Department of Labor. It provides detailed descriptions of occupations including required tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Metroverse-Jobs uses O*NET task complexity data to calculate complexity scores for each occupation, providing an additional dimension for understanding the economic composition of regions.
  </p>
  <h3>Geographic Coverage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>National:</strong> United States aggregate</li>
    <li><strong>States:</strong> All 50 US states</li>
    <li><strong>Metropolitan Areas:</strong> 21 top metro areas by employment</li>
  </ul>


about-research-title = Methodology
about-research-html =
  <p>
    Metroverse-Jobs adapts the visualization methodologies developed by the Growth Lab for the original <a target="_blank" href="https://metroverse.cid.harvard.edu/">Metroverse</a>, which builds on the <a target="_blank" href="https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/">Atlas of Economic Complexity</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Data Pipeline</h3>
  <p>
    Raw BLS OES data is processed through a pipeline that imports CSV files into a SQLite database, calculates derived metrics, and exports the results as static JSON files for the web application. The pipeline supports multiple years and geographic levels.
  </p>
  <h3>Occupation Classification</h3>
  <p>
    Occupations are classified using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. The treemap visualization groups occupations into 22 major groups (2-digit SOC codes) which serve as the top-level sectors, with more detailed breakdowns available at higher digit levels.
  </p>
  <h3>Complexity Scores</h3>
  <p>
    Complexity scores are derived from O*NET task data and provide a measure of the cognitive and analytical demands of each occupation. These scores are min-max normalized per region to enable comparison across geographic areas.
  </p>
  <h3>Related Research</h3>
  <p>
    The original Metroverse visualization approach is based on research by the Growth Lab, including work on industry spaces and economic complexity. For the foundational research, see:

faq-list-Q1-a =
  <p>
    Metroverse-Jobs is an adaptation of the <a target="_blank" href="https://metroverse.cid.harvard.edu/">Metroverse</a> urban economy navigator, originally built by the Growth Lab at Harvard University. This version has been adapted to visualize US occupation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system instead of the original NAICS industry classification.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool provides interactive treemap visualizations showing how employment is distributed across occupation groups for different US regions, along with wage and complexity data.
  </p>

faq-list-Q2-q = How is this different from the original Metroverse?
faq-list-Q2-a =
  <p>
    The original Metroverse covers over 1,000 cities worldwide using establishment-level data from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, classified by NAICS industry codes. Metroverse-Jobs focuses specifically on US occupation data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data source:</strong> BLS OES + O*NET (vs. Dun &amp; Bradstreet)</li>
    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> SOC occupation codes (vs. NAICS industry codes)</li>
    <li><strong>Geography:</strong> US National, States, and Metro Areas (vs. global cities)</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Static JSON files (vs. GraphQL API)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The visualization framework, treemap components, and UI are adapted from the original Metroverse open-source codebase.
  </p>

faq-list-Q3-q = Where does the data come from?
faq-list-Q3-a =
  <p>
    Metroverse-Jobs uses two primary data sources:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/">BLS Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OES)</a></strong>: Provides annual employment and wage estimates for over 800 occupations at national, state, and metropolitan levels.</li>
    <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.onetonline.org/">O*NET OnLine</a></strong>: Provides detailed occupation information including task descriptions used to calculate complexity scores.</li>
  </ul>

faq-list-Q4-q = What regions are covered?
faq-list-Q4-a =
  <p>
    Metroverse-Jobs currently covers three geographic levels:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>National:</strong> United States aggregate data</li>
    <li><strong>States:</strong> All 50 US states</li>
    <li><strong>Metropolitan Areas:</strong> 21 of the largest US metro areas by employment, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, and others</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Additional metro areas may be added in future updates as data becomes available.
  </p>

faq-list-Q5-q = What do the SOC codes mean?
faq-list-Q5-a =
  <p>
    SOC stands for <strong>Standard Occupational Classification</strong>, the system used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to categorize workers into occupational groups. SOC codes follow a hierarchical structure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2-digit (Major Group):</strong> e.g., 11-0000 = Management Occupations</li>
    <li><strong>3-digit (Minor Group):</strong> e.g., 11-1000 = Top Executives</li>
    <li><strong>5-digit (Broad Occupation):</strong> e.g., 11-1010 = Chief Executives</li>
    <li><strong>6-digit (Detailed Occupation):</strong> e.g., 11-1011 = Chief Executives</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In the Viz Options panel, you can change the digit level to view data at different levels of detail.
  </p>

faq-list-Q6-q = How is complexity calculated?
faq-list-Q6-a =
  <p>
    Complexity scores are derived from O*NET task data for each occupation. The scores reflect the cognitive and analytical demands of the work involved. Scores are min-max normalized per region so that they can be compared across different geographic areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the treemap visualization, you can color occupations by their complexity score to see which occupation groups tend to be more complex.
  </p>
